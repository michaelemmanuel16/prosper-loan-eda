# ProsperLoan - Analysis of BorrowerAPR and Loan Characteristics
## by Emmanuel Michael - Feb 2023


## Dataset

> The dataset used in this exploration contains information on loans facilitated by Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace. The data includes information on loan characteristics, borrower information, and loan performance.

>Before beginning the exploration, some data wrangling steps were performed on the original dataset. This included dropping unnecessary columns, fixing invalid entries and handling missing values to ensure quality and tidiness of the data. The cleaned was then used for exploratory analysis, which included univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. The analysis revealed interesting insights and relationships between the loan features, borrower characteristics, and loan performance. These insights can be used to inform future lending decisions.


## Summary of Findings

> Based on the analysis, it is evident that the BorrowerAPR is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the Prosper Rating, Income Range and Delinquencies. Higher Prosper Ratings are associated with lower APRs. 

> Additionally, the analysis found that the MonthlyLoanPayment is positively correlated with the LoanOriginalAmount, which indicates that borrowers who take out larger loans tend to have higher monthly payments.

> Overall, these insights suggest that borrowers should carefully consider various factors, such as their credit score, loan term, income range, current and past delinquencies, when taking out a loan. By doing so, they may be able to secure a lower APR and reduce their overall loan costs. Lenders, on the other hand, should take these factors into consideration when evaluating loan applications and setting interest rates to ensure that they are accurately reflecting the risk of the borrower.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The income range and prosper ratings are strong indicators how the borrowerAPR can be affected. Generally, the higher the income, the lower the APR. This is likely be due to the fact that since they earn more, they are able to settle their monthly payments without delinquencies. Borrowers who are seeking lower APRs may want to consider consider loan amounts lesser than income range so they easily make the monthly payments and increase their prosper ratings.
